I cannot directly capture `logcat` from your system. You will need to capture it yourself and then paste the relevant output here.

Here's how you can capture `logcat` from your terminal:

1.  **Clear existing logcat:**
    ```bash
    adb logcat -c
    ```
2.  **Start capturing logcat:**
    ```bash
    adb logcat > logcat_output.txt
    ```
3.  **Reproduce the issue:** On your Android device, try to perform the Google Sign-In again until you see the "cancelled" message.
4.  **Stop capturing logcat:** Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where `adb logcat` is running.
5.  **Provide the output:** Open the `logcat_output.txt` file and paste its content here. Please try to include the logs from the moment you initiate the sign-in until it shows "cancelled".

Alternatively, if you are using Android Studio, you can use the Logcat window within the IDE to filter and copy the relevant logs.
